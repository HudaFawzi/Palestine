    <string name="hebron_description">Hebron is a hauntingly beautiful, ancient city twisted and torn by decades of unrest and conflict. It is the largest city in the West Bank, and second largest in Palestine after Gaza. It is home to around 215,000 Palestinians.

It is also a modernising city, home to Hebron University and the Palestine Polytechnic University. Hebron is a hub of trade, primarily with the sale of marble from nearby quarries. The area is also renowned for grapes, figs, limestone, pottery workshops and glassblowing factories, as well as the major dairy product manufacturer, al-Junaidi.</string>

    <string name="beit_sahour">Beit Sahour</string>
    <string name="beit_sahour_description">The city of Beit Sahour and its Old Core are just a stone-throw away from Bethlehem. The name Beit Sahour is a subject of controversy but the most accepted interpretation is related to the shepherds who stay up till dawn, Sahar in Arabic, to watch over their flock. This interpretation is compatible with the tradition that considers the valley where the city is nestled, as the Shepherds’ field and underlines the links of the town with Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. The city is adamant about maintaining its traditions but has been at the vanguard of creative resistance movements against the Israeli Occupation.</string>
